# Monte Carlo Simulation
Monte Carlo refers to a computational method that uses random sampling and statistical techniques to solve complex problems or estimate numerical results. The method is named after the famous Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, known for its games of chance.

In Monte Carlo simulations, random numbers are generated repeatedly to model uncertain or random variables in a problem. The technique is particularly useful when deterministic methods are impractical or too time-consuming.
I used this technique, In the context of evaluating the effectiveness between traditional traffic lights and smart traffic lights, Monte Carlo simulation can be used to simulate various traffic scenarios and assess the performance of each system
